# Cute Roboliks &lt;3
Cute Robolicks &lt;3 is a little tiny cute robot game for the WOWIE! Game Jam 4.

Its very simple to play, easy to control your movements and overall fun to play.

 - WASD for Player movement
 - Arrow keys for Robot movement (if you have a blue line)
 - Right click to shoot sparks
 - "C" to clear sparks
 - "H"/"G" for Hitboxes

Hope you'll like my very first game for my very first Game Jam.
